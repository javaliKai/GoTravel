    <h1>GoTravel, by: Tommy 202053080023</h1>
    <p>Hello there! This HTML file is intended to give you some informations, my stories, requests, and any other relevant matters about this project. Besides, I want to learn how to apply a documentation for my project which I think a good practice.</p>
  <br>
  
  <h2>Font-Awesome</h2>
  <p>Notice that I use some third-party library called 'font-awesome' to grab some cute icons for me to use in the project. It's all included in the project file. An important thing to be noted, in order for the icons to show up, <strong>you need to at least have an internet connection</strong> (because that's how font-awesome work, fetching icons through the back-end side) otherwise, the icons won't show up.</p><br>
  
  <h2>Basic Idea</h2>
  <p>So the basic idea of the project is I wanted to make an online website for a travel agency called 'GoTravel' (and of course it's not real). The website provides general information about GoTravel, and the main feature I wanted to emphasize here is the booking page. The booking page allows the visitor to fill in a form and issue an online booking for travel services.</p>
  
  <h2>Styling</h2>
  <p>For the style, I determined all of them myself which probably you'll find some of it bad (I'm not a good designer btw, but eager to learn). I use a color picker online to generate a color scheme to be used throughout the pages.</p><br>
  <p>As for the font family, I downloaded a google font from fonts.google.com into my local project directory and import it into the CSS. </p>
  <p>Now for the CSS properties and layout, you may notice that I use some properties that are not learned during the web programming lecture. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>I use CSS 'Flexbox' property to adjust the navbar and footer spacing</li>
      <li>I use CSS variable to assign a custom name for my color scheme</li>
      <li>I applied a media query to make the website responsive in a mobile device</li>
    </ul>  
  </p><br>
  <p>For the Flexbox, I learned it myself and I understand how it works. It's a cool feature provided by CSS which organize my item more gracefully.</p>
  <p>For the variable, I learned it myself during my free time. I need it to keep track of my color scheme, so I don't need to type the hex code over and over again, saves time and more productive.</p>
  <p>And yeah, try to resize the website window to see the responsiveness.</p><br>
  
  <h2>Progress Tracking</h2>
  <p>You can track my progress <a href="./requirements.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>And since I've used github before for some of my personal projects, I made a git repository for this project. You can visit my github here: <a href="https://github.com/javaliKai/GoTravel" target="_blank">https://github.com/javaliKai/GoTravel</a> and click 'commits' to view all of my detailed progresses. The reason why I made all of this is because I want to be a well-managed person. Well, well-managed = less stress. And also maybe this may act as a proof that I did this whole thing by myself :D</p><br>
  
  <h2>Additionals</h2>
  <p>I created a webpage diagram for this project to summarize things up. Click <a href="./GoTravelPageLayout.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to view</p>
  <p>And one other thing, I actually used JS to automate the country selection item. Because, there are so many countries in the world and I don't want to hard code it myself, it'll be inconvenient. So, JS is the answer. But besides that, I didn't use to style my webpage, so I think It's allowed. If you want to look, visit <a href="./generateOption.js" target="_blank">here</a></p>
